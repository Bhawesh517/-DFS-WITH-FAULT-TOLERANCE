📦 Distributed File System (DFS) with Fault Tolerance — Visual Simulator
A fully interactive Distributed File System (DFS) Fault-Tolerance Simulator built with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. This project visually demonstrates how distributed systems such as HDFS, Ceph, Google File System (GFS), and Cassandra handle replication, node failures, auto-healing, rack awareness, block distribution, and data integrity.

Designed with a futuristic neon + glassmorphism UI, this simulator transforms complex system behaviors into clear, engaging visualizations.
